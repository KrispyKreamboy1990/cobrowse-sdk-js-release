## Implementation

Redaction allows you to remove specific elements from the agents view. This allows you to keep private user data private.

You can define redactions using a CSS selector entered into the web dashboard. Visit the [dashboard settings](https://cobrowse.io/dashboard/settings/redaction) to enter redaction selectors.
